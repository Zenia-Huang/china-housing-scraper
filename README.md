# Anjuke Housing Price Scraper

This Jupyter Notebook allows you to scrape historical housing price data from the [Anjuke](https://m.anjuke.com/), an online real estate marketplace in China.

## Usage:

1. Manually navigate to the Anjuke webpage for the city or province whose historical housing prices you want.

2. Replace the URL in the notebook with the webpage link you selected.

3. Run the notebook.

## Notes:

This approach does not require any complex API access or authentication.

Since the process requires manual selection of URLs, it is not suitable for large-scale automated scraping.
